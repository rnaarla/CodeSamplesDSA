# Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs/

"""
The time complexity is O(nlog(sum(jobs)âˆ’max(jobs))), where n is the number of jobs. This is because we perform a binary search in the range of [max(jobs), sum(jobs)] and for each mid value, we perform a depth-first search to check if it's possible to divide the jobs among the workers.

The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst-case scenario, the depth of the recursion tree can go up to n.
