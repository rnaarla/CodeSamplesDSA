## What happens in a ML Interview?
- Background and culture fit
- Whiteboard Coding (similar to SWE interviews)
- Pair Coding (similar to SWE-interviews)
- Pair debugging (often ML-specific code)
- Math puzzles (e.g. involving Linear Algebra)
- Take-home ML project
- Applied ML (e.g. explain how you'd solve this problem with ML)
- Previous ML projects (e.g. probing on what you tried, why things did/didn't work)
- ML Theory (e.g. bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, underfitting, understanding of specific algorithms)
- Deploy a pre-trained ML model
- API integrations
- Here’s a description of a component from our stack. Could you re-implement a toy version of it for me in one hour?

## How to Stand out for ML roles?
- Build SWE skills (e.g. work at a well-known software company)
- Exhibit interest in ML (e.g. conference attendance, online courses taken)
- Show you have broad knowledge of ML (e.g. write blog posts synthesizing a research area)
- Demonstrate ability to get ML projects done (e.g. create side projects, re-implement papers)
- Prove you can think creatively in ML (e.g. win Kaggle Competitions, publish papers)

## How to prepare for the interview?
- Prepare for a general SWE interview (e.g. Cracking the Coding Interview)
- Prepare to talk in detail about your past ML projects (remember details, prepare to talk about tradeoffs and decisions you made)
- Review how basic ML algorithms work (linear/logistic regression, nearest neighbor, decision trees, k-means, MLPs, ConvNets, reccurent nets, etc)
- Review ML theory 
- Think about the problems the company you're interviewing with may face and what ML techniques may apply to them
